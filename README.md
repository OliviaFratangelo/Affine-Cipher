# Affine-Cipher

I wrote this code as part of a cryptography project for my class in February 2023. I used Python to decrypt a ciphertext message encrypted with the Affine cipher using brute force. I implemented the Euclidian algorithm and modulo inverse to do so. The user enters the ciphertext only once and then the for loop I created allows the user to enter as many a and b values as they would like until they enter "2" to exit the loop after they find the a and b values that give the correct plaintext.
